This is an Image classification model made using tensorflow with the help of CIFAR-10 dataset available in Keras. 
The complete project is done in Python using Jupyter notebook.
The model classifies images into 10 categories namely:
 1. Automobile
 2. Dog
 3. Cat
 4. Truck
 5. Aeroplane
 6. Ship
 7. Deer
 8. Frog
 9. Horse
10. Bird
Tests were conducted using epoch of 10 and 20.
for epoch = 10, it achieved an accuracy of 67.55% while for epoch = 20, it achieved an accuracy of 70.31%.
gui.py runs the model in a Graphical User Interface with image upload and classification features (currently model with epoch = 20 is loaded).
Image_classification.py is the source code for generating the model.
Some images are available in Test Images folder for testing.
*the models files (.H5) are added as 2 parts each (for epoch = 10 and 20) in .rar format due to file size upload limit of github. It should be extracted before running the application.
